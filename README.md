This game is based on the "Monty Hall" problem. The gameshow host has the contestant pick one of three doors. Behind one door is the grand prize, a car. The other two have a goat behind them. After the contestant picks a door, the host reveals one of the doors with a goat. Two doors will remain, the door selected by the contestant, and one other. The host then asks the contestant if they want to switch their choice of doors. What would you do? Would you switch doors, or keep your choice? 

You should always switch your choice, as it increases your probability of winning the car from 1/3 to 2/3. Try it out for yourself with this code. You can play each round, or uncomment the auto selection and switch sections (don't forget to comment out the manual version of the selection and switch) to find out for yourself. Have fun and good luck!
